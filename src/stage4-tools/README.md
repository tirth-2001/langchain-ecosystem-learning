# 🔧 Stage 4 – Tools & Custom Integrations

**Objective:** Master the creation and integration of **custom tools** for LangChain agents, understand **built-in tools**, and learn to **wrap external services** (REST & GraphQL APIs).

## **📋 Stage 4 Breakdown**

### **4.1 Built-in Tools**

- **Calculator Tool** - Basic mathematical operations
- **Prebuilt Tools Combined** - Examples of using multiple built-in tools together

### **4.2 Custom Tools**

- **Temperature Conversion Tool** - Custom tool for temperature conversions
- **Weather Tool with Dynamic Structure** - Advanced custom tool with dynamic schemas
- **Custom External LMS API Tool** - Integration with external Learning Management System

### **4.3 API Integrations & Toolkits**

- **Food Delivery Agent Toolkit** - Complete toolkit for food delivery operations
  - Menu fetching, order calculation, restaurant search, order placement
- **Travel Planner Coordination** - Comprehensive travel planning toolkit
  - Hotel search, attraction search, weather lookup, itinerary formatting

### **4.4 Advanced Tool Patterns**

- **Tool Coordination Patterns** - How tools work together
- **Dynamic Structure Tools** - Tools that adapt their schema based on context
- **Tool Registry & Orchestration** - Managing multiple tools in complex workflows

## **🎯 Learning Outcomes**

By the end of Stage 4, you will be able to:

- ✅ Create custom tools using the `Tool` class
- ✅ Wrap external APIs (REST & GraphQL) as LangChain tools
- ✅ Build toolkits for specific domains (food delivery, travel planning)
- ✅ Implement dynamic tool schemas and coordination patterns
- ✅ Handle tool errors, retries, and fallback strategies
- ✅ Integrate tools with agents for real-world applications

## **🔗 Connection to Other Stages**

- **Stage 3 (Agents)**: Tools are consumed by agents for reasoning and acting
- **Stage 5 (Memory & RAG)**: Tools can integrate with memory systems and vector stores
- **Stage 6 (MERN Integration)**: Tools can be exposed via REST APIs
- **Stage 7 (LangGraph)**: Tools are orchestrated in complex workflows

## **🚀 Getting Started**

1. **Start with Built-in Tools**: Explore `built-in-tools/calculator-tool.ts`
2. **Create Custom Tools**: Follow examples in `custom-tools/`
3. **Build Toolkits**: Study `food-delivery-agent-toolkit/` and `travel-planner-coordination/`
4. **Read Documentation**: Check `notes/` folder for detailed explanations
